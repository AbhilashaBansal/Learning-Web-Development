        <p>Anime, sometimes called Japanimation, is hand-drawn and computer animation originating from Japan. The term 'anime' is derived from the English word animation, and in Japan is used to refer to all forms of animated media. Outside Japan, the term refers specifically to animation from Japan or to a Japanese-disseminated animation style often characterized by colorful graphics, vibrant characters and fantastical themes.</p>
        <p>Some of the most popular anime today include, 'Deathnote' (literally every anime lover started here), 'Pokemon' (the one we've watched since childhood), 'Dragon Ball', 'Naruto', 'Fullmetal Alchemist', 'Sailer Moon', 'Attack on Titan', 'One Piece' etc.</p>
